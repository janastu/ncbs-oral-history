 },
 {
   "Time": "00:27",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "Essentially I was covering the period 1962 to 1967. Now one person I forgot to bring up was R.N. Singh."
 },
 {
   "Time": "01:58",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "I should talk about him a little bit because he had an important role in setting up Molecular Biology. He was a scientific officer in the BARC. And just when I was setting up, he came and talked to me with a letter from his Head of the Department that he wanted to be transferred to TIFR. "
 },
 {
   "Time": "02:17",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "He was a chemist – he had no biology. But Sharma, who was the head of the Radiochemistry department, recommended him strongly. And I agreed to take him. So, actually he was also among the first people who were transferredthe first case of a man who was transferred from the BARC to this unit."
 },
 {
   "Time": "02:37",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "The main reason I took him was that he had a lot of experience with Isotope Chemistry. He said he wanted to learn Biology. But there he had been working with the isotope division. He was a Physical Chemist. I had the idea that this will help us in setting up a radioisotope laboratory in Bombay."
 },
 {
   "Time": "02:56",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "Singh then worked there all through. He also became a student, and he did a Ph.D. with me. He ultimately retired as a Professor in the Tata Institute. He did a lot of work on Drosophila - he set up the Neuro-anatomy lab for Drosophila."
 },
 {
   "Time": "03:16",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "Now, you have a question about whether I was spending all my time in administration. Actually I was not, because, you know, there was very little administration"
 },
 {
   "Time": "03:51",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "It was a small group, and I had all my time. So, in fact, in the very first labs which we set up, I was doing experiments and the people who were working with me were Apte, Pitale, Joshi, Bhavsar. The first things that I started were continuations of things in which I was interested when I was in England or things which I had started on when I was in the States. "
 },
 {
   "Time": "04:21",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "I went back to Aspergilus. I began to do some genetics of regulation of protein synthesis on Aspergilus and we [Apte, Pitale and I] started a project on the synthesis of arylsulphatase."
 },
 {
   "Time": "04:38",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "The idea I had was to start working with cellular organisms, not bacteria but eukaryotes, which have a nucleus. I made some point about the importance of Aspergilus and I have a paper in Cold Spring Harbor on the interaction of genes in the nucleus with the cytoplasm."
 },
 {
   "Time": "05:07",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "We started with Aspergilus because we wanted to work on a system where enzymes and genes were known and we chose arylsulphatase."
 },
 {
   "Time": "05:20",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "The reason I remember all this was that we had no money - not enough to buy the substrate for arylsulphatase, which was quite expensive."
 },
 {
   "Time": "05:31",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "So we used to get gift samples from chemical firms to work with. At some point, though, the gift samples were not enough. So Apte said, ‘Well, look, let us try and synthesize the substrates.’ So, the first year we spent a lot of time trying to synthesize the substrates for arylsulphatase doing some organic synthesis. Finally Apte did manage to make a lot of substrate"
 },
 {
   "Time": "06:02",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "Then came microbial genetics. I had a strong interest in the regulation of phosphatase in E. coli. These were all things that I had done in the US. So I continued to work on phosphatase, and started to look at genetic recombination by the expression of recombinant genes."
 },
 {
   "Time": "06:28",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "We did some work on how the gene, when it is transferred from HFR to F minus, begins to express in the F minus. That gives some information about transfer of DNA."
 },
 {
   "Time": "06:41",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "These were the things that my first Ph.D. student, P. Vijaysarthy worked on. Vijaysarthy began to do experiments on recombination, transfer of DNA, and integration of DNA."
 },
 {
   "Time": "07:00",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "The work on DNA recombination was done in Bombay and most of it is Vijaysarthy’s work. Only a small part of that is work which I did in the year that I was in MIT."
 },
 {
   "Time": "07:19",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "In 1963 or 1964 Anand Sarabhai and Hildegaard Lamfrom, who were in Cambridge had come. These were people I had got to know in Cambridge when I went there and we had a common interest in the nonsense mutation in phage and in T-4."
 },
 {
   "Time": "07:45",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "So Anand and Hildegaard both came and worked in Bombay on several visits. "
 },
 {
   "Time": "07:50",
   "Speaker": "IC",
   "Content": "Was this in 1967?"
 },
 {
   "Time": "08:00",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "I don’t remember. I will check the year. But it was in the early years. I also remember in 1964 we organized a course in which Maurie Fox [and] George Streisinger was a teacher – a man who became very important later—he discovered the first recombination enzyme, Lygase. And Marty Gellart was also a teacher."
 },
 {
   "Time": "08:20",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "That was our first course in Bombay. These were the visitors who came in the very first year. Then in 1964, because I was interested in recombination, in matings of HFR and F-, an Israeli scientist, Amos Oppenheimer, came to work with me."
 },
 {
   "Time": "08:48",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "He had worked in the States, he and Monica Riley had done some similar work with b-galactosidase. So in the years between 1962 and 1965, we were on the one hand, setting up the lab and on the other, I was actually doing my own experiments."
 },
 {
   "Time": "09:19",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "This is the period when Dr. Maitra came. His special interest was the enzymes of sugar metabolism, especially glycolysis and energy metabolism. "
 },
 {
   "Time": "09:37",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "He began to set up in this period, mostly working with yeast and E. coli. Most of this we were doing in the labs which we had in the C Block, while we were planning to set up labs in the new block, which was ready by 1967. "
 },
 {
   "Time": "10:16",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "I began actually to think about Neurobiology early in this period itself. During this year I was more or less regularly - every other year, if not every year - going to either England or to the States in the summers, just to keep up with what I was doing. "
 },
 {
   "Time": "10:50",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "At that time Alan Garen had moved to Yale. The first [couple of] years I went to Cambridge or to Yale, or both Cambridge and Yale, mostly to do experiments."
 },
 {
   "Time": "11:00",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "In those years the genetic code began to be solved, and at that time DNA sequencing was not possible. So the DNA sequence-based molecular biology that came later, towards the 70s, was not in sight and people who were working with microbial genetics began to think of other things which might be interesting."
 },
 {
   "Time": "11:30",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "There were two people who were very influential in later years: Sydney Brenner, who began to seriously consider working with a small model organism which would be multicellular, and therefore you could do development; and Seymour Benzer, who also was thinking on similar lines. He was also considering working on an organism with which one could do also brain research, neuroscience."
 },
 {
   "Time": "12:21",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "At that time the idea of neurobiology was not there. Benzer had actually taken a sabbatical from his job in Purdue, and become a fellow at Harvard Medical School in the neurobiology department there, working in the laboratory of Steve Kuffler. "
 },
 {
   "Time": "12:45",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "He spent two years teaching himself neurobiology and he was considering various possibilities – which organism to work with and so on. By 1965 or so Benzer had decided to go back and work with Drosophila. His main argument was that Drosophila genetics was already very well developed, so one would not have to waste time in starting new genetics."
 },
 {
   "Time": "13:17",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "And secondly he argued that Drosophila has sophisticated behaviour which the worm does not have. Brenner’s argument was that the worm has a brain of 300 neurons, so it should be possible to describe the complete structure of the brain."
 },
 {
   "Time": "13:36",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "Therefore you can do genetics of brain development and that would be very important in understanding behaviour. So these two people were already thinking of doing that. There were other people who were doing behavioural genetics with bacteria, for example people who had begun to work on bacterial chemotaxis."
 },
 {
   "Time": "13:57",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "I was aware of these things. I was friendly with people like Benzer and Brenner, so I knew these conversations. I began to have the feeling that all the things that we were trying to do in recombination and gene transfer and regulation, were more or less fast running out because whatever you tried to do, other people were doing similar things outside."
 },
 {
   "Time": "14:26",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "So I definitely felt that it would be a good idea to choose long-term projects, you know, which would take much longer to do, so you can work on your own."
 },
 {
   "Time": "14:42",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "Around this time, i.e. between 1964 and 1966, I had conversations with Brenner and Benzer about it - what would be a good thing to change to. I remember that very clearly, because the conversations were very pithy."
 },
 {
   "Time": "15:04",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "One summer, I think it was, it must have been 1964 or 1965, I went to Woodshole to see Benzer, when he was still at Harvard learning Neurobiology, and talked to him about this."
 },
 {
   "Time": "15:22",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "I had already by then known him through the work on nonsense mutations and had had earlier contact with him. So he said, ‘That’s a very good idea. You can keep on discussing and thinking about these things and there is no point in doing that - you just have to jump into it and start doing something. If I can help you in any way I will.’ Then he said, ‘I am going back to Caltech and I intend to work there. You go and directly work in Neurobiology. "
 },
 {
   "Time": "15:55",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "Whenever you make up your mind, come to Caltech, we will arrange for you to come.’ On one of my trips when I had this conversation with Brenner, he was as usual very, very straight and clear and he said, ‘Look, you can only do two things: either you can come here and work with C. elegans or you go to Seymour’s lab and work with Drosophila."
 },
 {
   "Time": "16:30",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "So when you have made up your mind you let me know.’ (Laughs) It was probably in 1966 that I had this conversation with Brenner."
 },
 {
   "Time": "16:41",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "So the idea of actually embarking on this enterprise was in my mind, but I was too busy with what was going on in Bombay - I just couldn’t think of taking off at that stage or doing anything. But when Maurie came to teach the course in 1964, we talked about some experiments on DNA transfer. "
 },
 {
   "Time": "17:09",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "He arranged for me to come to a small visiting professorship in Caltech before I went on a sabbatical. It may have been 1965 or 1966 - I will look it up. I had a short, three-month stay at MIT. When I went there, we did the experiments and we talked more about my future plans."
 },
 {
   "Time": "17:33",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "Maurie was doing microbial genetics. We had a common interest in DNA transfer and recombination. He suggested that I come to MIT. My deal was that I wanted to spend half of my time learning Neurobiology at MIT."
 },
 {
   "Time": "18:04",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "There were enough people at MIT and Harvard to enable me to do that. He said that that was fine. I said that the other half of the time, since I would be coming there, I would like to do experiments on recombination. So that’s what I did. In 1968, we moved to the new lab."
 },
 {
   "Time": "18:28",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "And towards the end of 1968 — at the end of 1968 or the beginning of 1969 - I took a long, two-year sabbatical, of which I spent one year at MIT and one year, three months at Caltech."
 },
 {
   "Time": "18:40",
   "Speaker": "IC",
   "Content": "So did you work with any particular person at MIT? "
 },
 {
   "Time": "18:50",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "I told you, I didn’t work with anybody at MIT. I went there and I went on to do what I was doing in Bombay. I mainly spent this time learning Neurobiology."
 },
 {
   "Time": "19:00",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "Yes, I taught at MIT, but I was a visiting professor there. I talked a great deal to Maurie Fox, with whom I was doing these experiments. These experiments were very similar to what Fox had been doing on l-Phage-density - labeling DNA and looking at transfer DNA. And we were trying to do similar experiments with e.coli."
 },
 {
   "Time": "19:29",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "I was trying to do some other things with Vijay Sarthy. So we tried to do similar experiments and some of those experiments in the end appeared in this paper in 1975, much after these we had actually done these experiments. In MIT, Maurie introduced me to a friend of his, who was a very old-time Neurophysiologist, Gerry Letwin. "
 },
 {
   "Time": "20:02",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "I got to know Gerry Letwin very well and talked a great deal with him. Letwin, is always a sort of a devil’s advocate about these things. He said, ‘Why do you want to go and work in Neuroscience, a field in which nothing new has been discovered in a hundred years? You are working in such a marvelous field, in molecular biologywhy do you want to change field?’"
 },
 {
   "Time": "20:32",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "But at the same time, he put me in touch with some people in his lab. A man called Weissbladt (?), who was working on cockroaches. So he told me to work with him, because he was trying to develop nervous system embryonic cells [of cockroach] in cultures."
 },
 {
   "Time": "20:58",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "That had been done - people had successfully cultured cockroach nervous system in primary cultures. So he said, ‘If you learn to do that, maybe you can do some Molecular Biology on nervous system neurons.’ So that was what I did. "
 },
 {
   "Time": "21:14",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "Then I took courses at MIT. There was a man called Joel Brown, who was teaching MIT students Neurobiology courses. So I learned techniques of Neurobiology in Joel Brown’s course. And then I made contact with people in Neurobiology at Harvard Medical School."
 },
 {
   "Time": "21:38",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "I took a course in Neurobiology at Harvard, Bio 205 it is called, which was taught by Kofler and his colleagues John Nicholls, Fershpan and Potler. Then I took an advanced course with Fershpan and Potter at Harvard Medical School."
 },
 {
   "Time": "21:59",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "So, most of my time that year, half of the year, was actually spent in learning Neurobiology and the other half of the year in doing some experiments in Fox’s lab. (Laughs)."
 },
 {
   "Time": "22:12",
   "Speaker": "IC",
   "Content": "That is quite interesting, because it seems that you were a visiting professor who was learning as well as doing experiments with somebody else."
 },
 {
   "Time": "22:20",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "Yeah, you see, American universities are very good. I mean, universities just leave you to yourself. You do what you like. I really had no particular obligation."
 },
 {
   "Time": "22:29",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "If I wanted to teach a course or give a lecture, I could do that. But nobody was asking me what I was doing. I enjoyed that. I had lots of friends at MIT, many people that I knew from earlier years. It was a very pleasant year. But actually, the only structured thing that I was doing was teaching myself. During that year, a very vivid memory I have is of a Japanese scientist, David Suzuki."
 },
 {
   "Time": "24:12 ",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "He came to MIT to give a lecture. He is a well-known geneticist, later on he turned to work with television and became a professional presenter of science programmes. David Suzuki had discovered the first temperature-paralyzed mutants of Drosophila. I was very interested in temperature-sensitive mutations, right from the beginning."
 },
 {
   "Time": "24:32 ",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "Pontecorvo had introduced me to temperature-sensitive mutants in yeast and bacteria. So David came to lecture at MIT and I remember that he had a test tube of Drosophila mutant paratese it is calledparalyzed temperature sensitivein his coat pocket."
 },
 {
   "Time": "24:57 ",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "When he was lecturing, he took out the tube and held it in his hand. When he removed the hand, of course, all the flies were paralyzed and fell to the bottom. I was fascinated by this lecture, because anybody could see that this paralysis might involve the blocking of the nervous systemeither nerve-conduction or synapses."
 },
 {
   "Time": "25:20 ",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "I actually made up my mind right then that that was what I was going to work onparalyzed mutants. Even before I went to Caltech, I knew that that’s what I was going to do. Subsequently, when I did go to Caltech the next year, I told Seymour that that was what I wanted to do. He said, ‘Do what you like.’ His lab always was like that - he never told to anyone what they should do."
 },
 {
   "Time": "25:49 ",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "Everyone did what they wanted to do. So in his lab lots of things were going on. He was primarily interested at that time, I think, in visual mutants, but he had become interested in paralyzed mutants. At that time, they had set up a large collection of mutagenized Drosophila lines, which had mutations that had been selected."
 },
 {
   "Time": "26:14 ",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "So the first thing was I did was picked up from that collection a number of paralyzed mutants which were paralyzing at high temperature. And I started looking at the neuro-physiological defects in these mutants."
 },
 {
   "Time": "26:29 ",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "That, in fact, turned out to be successful and by the end of the year we had already identified at least three mutants which had clear neuro-physiological defects."
 },
 {
   "Time": "26:44 ",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "That was interesting because at that time no neuro-physiology had been done with Drosophila, so the methods were not very clear. So during that year whatever neuro-physiology I had learned at Harvard came in handy. I also talked to a lot of other neuro-physiologists at Caltech who could help."
 },
 {
   "Time": "27:07 ",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "One of Benzer’s associates, Yoshiki Hota, was doing physiology. He passed on the physiology lab to me - by then he had become very interested in Mosaic mapping. I had no difficulty in learning whatever physiology of Drosophila was possible from Yoshiki Hota and began to work on the flies."
 },
 {
   "Time": "27:37 ",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "What we did, basically, was to work out a system in which you could record from muscles - excite the axons and then see in a mutant whether nerve-conduction is affected or synaptic transmission is affected. Then by testing the mutants, we found at least three of the genes which were affecting either conduction or synaptic transmission. So that’s the story of paralyzed mutants."
 },
 {
   "Time": "28:12 ",
   "Speaker": "IC",
   "Content": "I just wanted to know, since you did have a long association with Benzer, if you would like to talk about this interaction a little. It’s obvious that you were talking to him throughout, not just when you went to Caltech."
 },
 {
   "Time": "28:35 ",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "Well, I first met him, when I went in 1961 to Cold Spring Harbor. I had met him before, when he had come to Scotland, but then we didn’t talk much. But in 1961, I had come to know him. In ’61, throughout the year my work was connected with him. We were working with similar problems - he was at Purdue and I was in Philadelphia. I was in touch with him."
 },
 {
   "Time": "29:07 ",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "This became more intense when you went to Caltech, obviously"
 },
 {
   "Time": "29:15",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "In Caltech, we actually worked in the same place and we talked. His style of work is that he always does his own work but he always has one room in the lab that is the restaurant, where everybody collects for lunch. For one or two hours, as long as people wanted to sit there, they would talk to each other."
 },
 {
   "Time": "29:34 ",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "That is where all the conversation about science took place. He left people to their own devices to find out what they were doing. He became very interested in my work towards the end, and this discovery that you could actually do this with paralyzed mutants came very late. The whole year almost nothing was happening. [Laughs]"
 },
 {
   "Time": "29:59 ",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "Most of the time in science, what you do doesn’t work. And once in a while something begins to work. That’s characteristic, when something interesting is happening. If you do something which is obvious, then of course, you produce lot of data, but that’s not interesting. [Laughs] "
 },
 {
   "Time": "30:16 ",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "So, nothing happened during the year, but just towards the end, I found out that you could do this. Benzer then became very interested. That summer we went to Cold Spring Harbor. He arranged for me to give a talk at Cold Spring Harbor on this. I gave the talk, but when we wrote the paper he said, ‘Look, we need to do more. It is not enough—we need to have more.’ "
 },
 {
   "Time": "30:52 ",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "He persuaded me to stay on longer for the summer, and then come back the next summer. We actually completed this paper two years later - that paper was published in 1972 or 1973. Scientific interaction actually came towards the end of this. But there was a lot of personal interactionwe were working in the same lab. "
 },
 {
   "Time": "31:23 ",
   "Speaker": "IC",
   "Content": "So, during this longish stay, what happened to your family? Did they come with you? "
 },
 {
   "Time": "31:36 ",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "No, at Caltech, the family was with me. Both at Boston and in Caltech. Asiya went with me and children. For two years we were completely away. Asiya was also working at Caltechshe was teaching. At MIT, when we were in Boston, she was doing various things."
 },
 {
   "Time": "32:03 ",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "Then I returned to Bombay in 1972"
 },
 {
   "Time": "32:22",
   "Speaker": "IC",
   "Content": "[Your return] more or less marked a turning point…."
 },
 {
   "Time": "32:32",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "That was the turning point because by then I definitely knew that I wanted to work with Drosophila."
 },
 {
   "Time": "32:44 ",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "The main idea I wanted to pursue was to combine Neurophysiology with Genetics because I had learned to do a variety of neurophysiological experiments with Drosophila and I had learned how to do Genetics in this."
 },
 {
   "Time": "33:04 ",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "Now I must say one little thing there, though sequentially, it comes later. When I came back to Bombay, in my absence my colleagues had selected students for the coming year. One of these students had been sort of year-marked for me - Satpal Singh. I persuaded both Satpal Singh and R.N. Singh, who had previously been doing molecular biology with me, to start working with Drosophila. "
 },
 {
   "Time": "33:53 ",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "The first three years or so we worked with paralysed mutants, temperature sensitive mutants—we continued more or less what I was doing in Caltech. Satpal and R.N. Singh isolated new sets of paralyzed mutants"
 },
 {
   "Time": "34:29 ",
   "Speaker": "IC",
   "Content": "Can I just ask a question about lab conditions and equipment? You were able to do the same kind of experiments as you did in Caltech? "
 },
 {
   "Time": "34:41 ",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "No, no I wasn’t. When I came back it took some time. The reason was that we had equipped the lab in these first ten years for doing Molecular Biology. But there was no equipment for Neurophysiology. So I had to write a project which had to go to the planning commission to be able to start Neurobiology. "
 },
 {
   "Time": "35:04 ",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "And it ran into some problems, because some people raised questions like, ‘How can the Tata Institute do Neurobiology? Facilities for it are not there.’ and so on. Anyway, we went over this and we managed to get an allocation to buy equipment."
 },
 {
   "Time": "35:17 ",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "So we had money to buy equipment. Also I got grantsthere were outside agencies which gave grants. So, at that time we didn’t have monetary problems in buying equipmentnot the same kind of problems that we had had in earlier years. It took about a year or so to set up the physiology lab and to begin to do physiology experiments. So that’s the first part from, let us say, 1970 to 1975."

   "Content": "We were mostly working on paralytic mutants, looking at paralyzed mutant physiology, when Veronica came as a student. I think she came in 1976. I had had some ideas about starting to studying olfaction in Drosophila. I had developed an interest in olfaction in talking to Gerry Letwin at MIT. He had done some of the earliest work on studying olfaction in insects, in flies, especially larger flies."
 },
 {
   "Time": "36:45 ",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "He had a paper which had made an impression on me, in which he had made recordings in various insects, I think larger flies. In a footnote he had said that he had also made these recordings in Drosophila. So I knew that you could do olfactory physiology with Drosophila, but we hadn’t done anything in that connection."

 {
   "Time": "37:13 ",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "I had first suggested to R.N. Singh that he try and make a maze for developing olfactory response, and I think he constructed something but it never worked. But when Veronica came as a student, she became very interested in taking up olfactory behaviour. So around that time in 1976 we began to study olfaction and Drosophila. "

   "Time": "37:53 ",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "As you will see, the first papers on olfaction appeared in 1978, 1979, 1980. There are other people who joined the lab at this stage. Again as a result of my conversations with Brenner, during this period when I came back we had again another set of courses organized. Some of these courses were done with help of John Nicholls in Neurobiology and Neurophysiology."

   "Content": "Where were they coming from? Which universities were they"
 },
 {
   "Time": "39:11",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "America, usually. Mostly these were Americans. I mean, John Nicholls at that time was in Harvard and I had come to know quite well during my year at MIT, though I had met him before at Woodshole. So when I came back and I was trying to set up a physiology lab he was very helpful."
 },
 {
   "Time": "39:21 ",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "He provided me with all the information about equipment, what to buy, how to set up the lab and so on. And so we began to organize Neurobiology courses. In subsequent years there were three or four Neurobiology courses organized with the help of the International Brain Research Organization. "

 {
   "Time": "39:42 ",

 },
 {
   "Time": "40:12",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "Well, in my work, yes. Not for everyone. At that time I had various conversations with people who had come here to teach courses. One summer I had asked Sydney Brenner to come, and he came for a few weeks and he taught at Bombay. But he took this time to actually talk to all the members of the staff and to make an assessment of the direction in which we were going. "
 },
 {
   "Time": "40:27 ",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "One of the things Brenner said, very clearly, was that one of the mistakes we were making was that too few people were doing too many things. They must work in such a way that there is some concentration of effort. It should not be such that everybody is doing what someone is telling him, but people must work in a concentrated way, otherwise each one would keep on doing what they were doing."
 },
 {
   "Time": "41:03 ",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "I saw the point because I saw that we had already been working for ten years, and each individual was essentially carrying on his individual project. Now, that works very well if you have very large resources and if individuals can more or less raise their own resources. But in our system individuals wanted to do whatever they could but they still expected those resources to be raised by others. That raises serious problems in running institutions."
 },
 {
   "Time": "41:31 ",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "So we began to take steps to develop one concentration, around Drosophila - Drosophila Genetics, Drosophila Behaviour, Drosophila Development. By that time, Dr. Babu had come back from Caltech and had joined us. He went and spent a year in Cambridge and came back to set up a project on C. elegans."
 },
 {
   "Time": "42:01 ",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "But after my conversation with Brenner, Brenner persuaded him not to do this but to actually change to Drosophila. Babu made another visit to Cambridge and then he began to work on Drosophila."

 {
   "Time": "42:13 ",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "Around that time, Veronica and then Vijay were made Research Associates. Dr. Krishnan, who had earlier come and taken courses at TIFR, came back from States. He had taken a degree in Biophysics from the Indian Institute and done a couple of years of sabbatical in the US."
 },
 {
   "Time": "42:52 ",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "He was familiar with what was going on in TIFR, so when he came back he got an appointment at TIFR and he began to work on Drosophila. So Babu, R.N. Singh, Krishnan, Venky and I, and later on Veronica and Vijay - a whole bunch of people in TIFR, independent groups were all working with Drosophila. Drosophila work became very central."
 },
 {
   "Time": "43:32 ",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "But together with this another interesting thing happened. This was the period in which Anil Sadgopal came to Bombay. This was the ’70s. Towards the end of the ’70s, Microbial Genetics got a second lease of life because DNA sequencing was discovered, so a lot of people began to work on DNA sequencing"
 },
 {
   "Time": "43:57 ",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "Around this time Dr. Maitra took a sabbatical and he went to the States. Zita also took a sabbatical. They both come back and they made an effort to set up DNA sequencing, microbial molecular genetics, in Bombay."
 },
 {
   "Time": "44:26 ",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "By then he had begun to work with yeast. He made a strong effort to attract people to do molecular biology. He was a very successful person as far as his yeast work is concerned. So, at that time I thought that it would be a good idea if two concentrations were developeda set of people working around Drosophila and Neurobiology and Developmental Biology, and another set of people doing Molecular Biology with microorganisms."
 },
 {
   "Time": "44:56",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "But the second concentration, I am afraid, did not grow as much because the number of groups working in that area remained small. We made some offers of employment to people to work on yeast genetics."
 },
 {
   "Time": "45:11",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "So there were other people who continued to work in other areas. You know, we made our appointments there. I think that situation even now is the same. You have some sort of a concentration of people working on Drosophila Neurobiology and then individuals who are working on other things. Neurobiology continues to be a concentration. "

 {
   "Time": "45:43",
   "Speaker": "IC",
   "Content": "I wanted to have you talk about a bit about the Bhatnagar award which came in ’76."
 },
 {
   "Time": "45:00",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "What I had done with Bacterial Genetics, Aspergilus Genetics was known."
 },
 {
   "Time": "46:23",
   "Speaker": "OS",
   "Content": "So I think the Bhatnagar award came for that. I think I was elected to the Indian academy also in 1966 or something."
